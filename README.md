## AP Calc BC Notes

by Bryan Deng

I made these notes and wrote hundreds of lines of latex because I was too lazy to write notes by hand.

I had an old repository but didn't sync that one up with my local git. It got messy so I just decided to make a new one :)

## TODO List

- add section for how to find points of intersection on TI-84 (and integrals maybe)
